304,shark,"sharp, powerful teeth and jaws, never sleeps and must always keep moving to survive.","i gather that they found their perfect place in the evolutionary scheme and have not really evolved for millions of years. their size and teeth make them apex aquatic predators, i have no idea why they would evolve to have to keep moving to keep from suffocating, but i wouldn't want to fall asleep under those conditions either.",1,0,bio,male,white / european-american,71
304,bat,"leathery wings, powerful hearing and ability to use echo location","i would say evolution, but others would say god. since it moves around very quickly in the dark, the echo location is essential, and wouldn't we all want wings if we could grow them?",1,0,bio,male,white / european-american,71
304,turkey,"fan and feathers, long neck that changes color, wattles","the fan is for sexual attraction and to look bigger to predators. the changing colors in the neck are for communication and seduction. i can't conceive why wattles are evolutionary necessary, but they may contain glands. i don't know much about turkeys.",1,0,bio,male,white / european-american,71
305,fly,"flies have huge compound eyes that give them nearly 360-degree vision.
this helps them detect motion extremely well—great for finding food and avoiding predators","any flies go from egg to adult in just days.
this fast reproductive cycle helps them survive in changing environments and explains why populations can explode quickly.",0,0,bio,male,white / european-american,32
305,coyote,"coyotes can interbreed with wolves and dogs, creating hybrids like coywolves or coydogs, but they are still considered a distinct species.","plays a crucial role in ecosystems by controlling populations of rodents, rabbits, and other small animals",1,0,bio,male,white / european-american,32
305,bat,"bats are the only mammals capable of sustained powered flight (not just gliding like flying squirrels).
their wings are modified hands—literally! the wing membrane (called the patagium) stretches across elongated fingers.","bats likely evolved from small, tree-dwelling mammals that glided between branches.
over time, natural selection favored individuals who could glide farther, then flap, and eventually fly.
wings gave them access to new food sources (flying insects) and escape from predators.",1,0,bio,male,white / european-american,32
305,turkey,"turkeys, especially males (toms), have large tail feathers they fan out during courtship displays.
their feathers have a metallic sheen that changes in the light.","turkeys live in forests and open fields where it's more efficient to walk or run than fly. strong legs help them scratch for food, escape predators quickly, and roost in trees at night.
