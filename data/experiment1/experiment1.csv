Thank you for agreeing to take part in this study. We appreciate your time and effort. In this study, we will present you with a fictional scenario, and then we will ask you to answer a brief series of questions about that scenario. The questions have no right or wrong answers-- weâ€™re just exploring features of human psychology in this research. You will be paid $0.70 for your time and efforts. We do not anticipate any risks from participating in this research. While you will not directly benefit from taking part in this research study, we hope society and the scientific community will benefit from the knowledge gained about human psychology and judgment.

 

Your involvement should take about 5 minutes. Your participation is voluntary and you can stop at any time. If you consent to take part in this survey, please indicate so below, and then click the arrow to advance. If not, simply close your browser window. 

 

The research data will be collected anonymously. We will not ask you to provide any personally identifiable information (such as an email-address, name, etc.) and will not be able to link your response to you. We anticipate that your participation in this survey presents no greater risk than everyday use of the Internet. Of course, please note that there is always the possible risk of intrusion by outside agents (i.e. hacking) whenever information shared over the Internet. In order to keep your identifying information and data from this study separate, we will host the survey on an unaffiliated platform, Qualtrics. Thus, Prolific will not have access to the data you provide us. Additionally, we will not ask for directly or indirectly identifiable information in the survey. 

 

If you have any questions about the research study, please contact Shaun Nichols (sbn44@cornell.edu) at Cornell University. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this study, you may contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for Human Participants at 607-255-5138 or access their website at http://www.irb.cornell.edu. You may also report your concerns or complaints anonymously through Ethicspoint online at www.hotline.cornell.edu or by calling toll free at 1-866-293-3077. Ethicspoint is an independent organization that serves as a liaison between the University and the person bringing the complaint so that anonymity can be ensured.

 Taking part in this study is voluntary. You can stop at any time. Withdrawal or refusal to participate will not result in any penalty. You do not waive any legal rights or release any agent from liability for negligence by consenting to participate.

Distinctive facial markings â€“ Especially the black ""mask"" around their eyes, which gives raccoons their signature look.

Ringed tail â€“ A bushy tail with alternating dark and light rings.

Dexterous front paws â€“ Raccoons have incredibly nimble hands, capable of opening containers, manipulating objects, and even unlatching doors.

Nocturnal behavior â€“ They're primarily active at night and have excellent night vision.

Omnivorous diet â€“ Raccoons eat a wide variety of foods, from fruits and insects to small animals and human leftovers.

Curiosity and intelligence â€“ They're known for being clever problem-solvers and very adaptable to urban environments.","The black eye mask might reduce glare and help with night vision, giving raccoons an edge as nocturnal foragers.

The ringed tail could help with communication or camouflage in wooded environments.

Their dexterous paws evolved because being able to manipulate and open things gave them access to more food sourcesâ€”key to survival.

Their omnivorous diet and intelligence make them incredibly adaptable, which has helped them thrive in both wild and urban settings.

And their nocturnal habits likely developed to avoid predators and human activity, while still having access to food.","Distinctive black-and-white coloration â€“ Their bold stripes or patterns serve as a warning to predators.

Powerful scent glands â€“ Located near the tail, these spray a strong, foul-smelling liquid used as a defense mechanism.

Stocky body with short legs â€“ Built for digging and foraging close to the ground.

Nocturnal behavior â€“ Skunks are mostly active at night, which helps them avoid predators.

Omnivorous diet â€“ They eat a wide variety of foods, including insects, small animals, plants, and fruit.

Solitary and slow-moving nature â€“ They typically avoid confrontation, relying on their scent spray as a last resort.","The black-and-white coloration acts as a warning signal (aposematism) to potential predators, advertising that skunks have a powerful and unpleasant defense.

The strong scent glands evolved as an effective chemical defense, deterring predators without the skunk needing to fight or flee.

Their stocky body and digging abilities help them find food like insects and small animals underground, increasing their chances of survival.

Being nocturnal likely developed to avoid many predators and human activity, while taking advantage of nighttime food sources.

The omnivorous diet makes them adaptable, able to eat whatever is available, which is beneficial in varied environments.

Their solitary and slow-moving behavior minimizes unnecessary confrontations, reserving their costly defense spray for real threats.","Bald head â€“ Lacking feathers on the head and neck helps vultures stay clean when feeding on carcasses.

Hooked beak â€“ Strong and curved, perfect for tearing through tough skin and muscle of dead animals.

Large wings and excellent soaring ability â€“ Vultures have broad wings suited for gliding long distances with minimal effort as they search for food.

Highly developed sense of smell or sight â€“ Depending on the species, vultures use either keen eyesight (Old World vultures) or a strong sense of smell (New World vultures) to locate carrion.

Scavenging behavior â€“ Vultures almost exclusively feed on dead animals, which places them in a unique ecological role as natureâ€™s clean-up crew.

Strong digestive system â€“ Their stomach acid is powerful enough to kill dangerous bacteria and pathogens found in decaying meat.","The bald head likely evolved because feathers would get dirty and trap bacteria when feeding inside carcasses, so having bare skin helps vultures stay cleaner and avoid infections.

Their hooked beak developed to efficiently tear through tough, decomposing flesh.

Large wings and soaring ability evolved to allow vultures to cover vast areas with minimal energy, essential for finding rare and scattered food sources.

Their keen sensesâ€”either sight or smellâ€” are adaptations to quickly locate carcasses from high in the sky or over large distances.

The strong digestive system evolved to neutralize harmful bacteria and toxins in decayed meat, allowing vultures to safely consume food that would be deadly to many other animals.","Fuzzy body with branched hairs â€“ These help bees collect and carry pollen, making them efficient pollinators.

Two pairs of wings â€“ Bees have a forewing and hindwing on each side that hook together in flight.

Antennae â€“ Used for sensing smells, vibrations, and navigation.

Pollen-carrying structures â€“ Like pollen baskets (corbiculae) on their hind legs, especially in honeybees and bumblebees.

A stinger (in most females) â€“ Used for defense, though not all bees can sting.

Complex social behavior (in some species) â€“ Especially in honeybees, which live in colonies with a queen, workers, and drones.

Ability to make and consume nectar and pollen â€“ Bees rely on flowers for food and are key pollinators for many plants.","Hairy bodies and pollen baskets evolved because bees that could collect and carry more pollen were better at feeding themselves and their offspring, so those traits were passed on.

Two pairs of wings provide strong, agile flightâ€”important for traveling between flowers.

Antennae became highly sensitive to smells and signals, helping bees find flowers and communicate.

The stinger developed as a defense mechanism, especially in social species where protecting the hive is vital.

Social structures, like in honeybee colonies, evolved because cooperation increased survivalâ€”bees working together could defend the nest, care for young, and gather more food.

Feeding on nectar and pollen shaped their close relationship with flowering plants, leading to co-evolution where both bees and plants adapted to benefit each other.",,,,,,,,,Female,28,White / European-American,Biological
